Atomic design is a methodology for creating design systems.

Atoms: The basic building blocks of the design (e.g., buttons, inputs, labels).
Molecules: Groups of atoms bonded together to form a more complex component (e.g., a form field with a label and input).
Organisms: Groups of molecules joined together to form a distinct section of an interface (e.g., a navigation bar).
Templates: Groups of organisms combined to create pages.
Pages: Specific instances of templates that show what a UI looks like with real content.
